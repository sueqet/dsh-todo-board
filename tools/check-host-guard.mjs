/**
 * Mutation check for the host-half behaviours that no other suite can prove.
 *
 * Every mutant here is the kind that a green suite keeps green after the code is
 * deleted — which is the only reason this file exists:
 *
 *   - **the approval gate** (v0.9.1) — delete it and every write still works, silently;
 *   - **channel convergence** (v0.9.1) — prefer the local restatement again and the
 *     board route once more accepts any local process;
 *   - **the `ctx.inject` rewrite** (v0.9.1) — go back to a load-order-dependent read
 *     at apply time and the model tool silently disappears (the panel keeps working,
 *     which is exactly why nobody noticed for so long);
 *   - **the model-side actions** (v0.9.1) — drop a guard and `update` half-applies,
 *     `reorder` crosses directories, or `dispatch` re-sends a row;
 *   - **planning** (v0.11.0) — the promises that make a one-approval batch honest
 *     (all-or-nothing, and a dialog that shows the plan) and the two thresholds plus
 *     the one-shot rule that keep the planning offer from becoming noise.
 *
 * So each is applied in turn and the suite that owns it must FAIL. The mutant is
 * reverted on every exit path — including Ctrl-C — and `lib/index.js` is verified
 * byte-for-byte before the run is reported as successful: this file is what the
 * live dev install loads.
 *
 * The child's output is deliberately NOT piped: under a restricted sandbox a
 * piped stdio spawn fails with EPERM, which would look exactly like a caught
 * mutation. Only the exit status is inspected.

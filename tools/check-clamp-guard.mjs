/**
 * Mutation check for the viewport-clamp tests.
 *
 * A green suite proves nothing unless the tests can actually fail. This applies
 * each half of the bug in turn and asserts `client-smoke.mjs` catches it:
 *
 *   1. no resize listener   — the panel is cropped when the window narrows
 *   2. no clamp on load     — an off-screen stored layout stays off-screen
 *
 * The child's output is deliberately NOT piped: under a restricted sandbox a
 * piped stdio spawn fails with EPERM, which would look exactly like a caught
 * mutation. Only the exit status is inspected.
 *
 * This rewrites `client/client.js` for the duration of each mutant, so the
 * original is restored on every exit path — including Ctrl-C — and verified
 * byte-for-byte before the run is reported as successful. That matters here
 * because the dev install is a junction onto this very file.
 *
 *   node tools/check-clamp-guard.mjs

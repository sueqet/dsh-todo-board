/**
 * Mutation check for the row-facts, row-schedule, skin and paste tests.
 *
 * Confirms `client-smoke.mjs` really fails when each behaviour is reverted:
 *
 *   1. the directory chip comes back (a fact stated twice)
 *   2. the schedule is repeated in the facts line (same, other direction)
 *   3. an unscheduled row loses its way to add a time
 *   4. editing sends nothing (the picker is decorative)
 *   5. pending rows fall silent again (a state you must infer)
 *   6. done rows fall silent again (same, other state)
 *   7. the skin control stops remembering the choice
 *   8. the skin control stops reaching the DOM attribute the sheets hook onto
 *   9. a skin erases the section label instead of restyling it
 *  10. a skin's rules escape the panel and restyle the whole GUI
 *  11. one of the two optional skins is never injected
 *  12. a text paste is swallowed (the composer's main input breaks)
 *  13. an image paste is not intercepted (the image never attaches)
 *  14. a typeless clipboard image keeps its empty media type
 *  15. the per-todo image limit is not enforced on paste
 *  16. a non-image file paste is consumed by mistake
 *  17. the client build marker drifts from package.json (the footer lies)
 *  18. the removed standing hint comes back into the composer
 *  19. the attachment counter disappears once an image is attached
 *  20. the board view starts pulling log content (logs leak to every user)
 *  21. the log view stops fetching when it opens (the button looks dead)
 *  22. the log dot never clears (it stops meaning "something is wrong")
 *  23. every log level can be switched off (empty reads as "nothing logged")
 *  24. the log poll reads `logOpen` from a stale closure (the open view freezes)
 *  25. a refused poll reports a bare status code (nothing to act on)
 *
 * Patterns are matched against a normalized (LF) copy because the working tree
 * is checked out with CRLF on Windows, then the replacement is mapped back onto
 * the original text so line endings survive untouched.
 *
 * As with the clamp guard, the child's stdio is not piped — under a restricted
 * sandbox a piped spawn fails with EPERM, which would masquerade as a caught
 * mutation. `client/client.js` is restored on every exit path and verified
 * byte-for-byte, because the dev install is a junction onto this file.
 *
